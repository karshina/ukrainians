title: The Ukrainians

index:
  content: This film is a documental story about creation of the new Ukrainian army. Ukrainian people rebelled against the criminal government that was a vassal of the Russian Empire. Furious colonizer threw its own military in Ukraine and under the automats’ muzzles grabbed a part of our territory. In that case patriots-volunteers did not agree to give our land to the enemy. 242 – it’s an amount of days of the heroic defense of Donetsk airport.
